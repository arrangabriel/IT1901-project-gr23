## Planned implementations that was not ready for release 2
We did plan to be able to show and calculate statistics for this release. The statistics class was created to handle different type of calculations and the statistics fxml file was also created to display data. We did however find out that it was better to focus on improving test coverage and code quality rather than to implement more features. US3 and US4 were created and added to the project and some of the functionality displayed here are found in the code that we decided to delay for release 3.
