# Release 1

For release one we intend to create a MVP of the project.

## Idea for the project

We intend for the project to be an exercise/activity tracker. We have created a figma model for release 1, which is meant to illustrate our goal for this first release. 

The figma model can be found here:

### Log a workout
The following will be included in a log:

- Title
- Date
- Duration
- Comment

### View workout log
There will be a workout log where all of the added workouts will appear as a list. For the MVP this log can not be interacted with, but it is meant to be expanded. 

The MVP is focused on solving the most basic user story, where the problem is to be able to store a workout with a comment. 
This user story can be found here:
