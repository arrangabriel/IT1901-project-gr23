# Get Fit

Get Fit is an application for storing and logging activity and exercise. The user will add data like duration, exercise form and a comment when adding a new session. The application will store and organize the data and can do calculations based on the input data of the user. Examples of these calculations can be average pace per kilometer and calories burnt during a workout. These calculations can also be expanded in the future. Because the sessions include the date, the user can choose to view the compressed data for a time period, like how many hours the user has exercised during a year.
